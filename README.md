# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: SEO Optimization

##Task

The whole idea of this week 1 homework was to review the [Homework Guide](./Homework-Guide/README.md) and  **Refactor** existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards  for front-end and junior developers. 

> **Important**:Adhering to the **Scout Rule**&mdash;always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

Also, web **accessibility** rules had to be followed to ensure that people with disabilities can access a website using 
assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. 
I started the assignment by creating a repository on my GitHub account and cloning it to my computer. 
Naming the repo was one of the important tasks for the assignment. I selected the name 'SEO-OPTIMIZATION'for my repo. 
As per the user story, the marketing agency wanted the code base for their website as per the accessibility standards 
so that the site might be optimized for search engines like Google. 
Garnering more visibility can always help to make the potential clients to click and convert over the website.
 This whole thoughts of importance of SEO for a website made me choose this name for the repo. 
# Steps followed for Code Refactoring
1. Title was named website, changed the name to Horiseon. 
2. Checked out if all the links work properly. One of the links were not working. 
The HTML id attribute was not defined for Search-engine-optimization.
3. Consolidated the CSS selector's and properties nad organized them to follow the semantic structure. 
4. Ensured the existing code is as per semantic HTML standards.
5. Reviewed all the images and provided an alt tag to improvise the web accessibility. 
6. Commented the CSS and HTML Files properly. 

After code refactoring, used git add, git commit and git push commands to save and push my code to the GitHub repository. 
Then deployed the application in to GitHub.
